# These intervals are to be combined into chords and possibly scales.
# The list below consists of the shorthand name for the interval, followed
# by the number of semitones which that interval increases the preceeding note.
# The interval designations are as follow: Perfect Unison, minor 2ND, Major 2ND,
# minor 3RD, Major 3RD, Perfect 4TH, Augmented 4TH, Diminished 5TH, Perfect 5TH,
# minor 6TH, Major 6TH, minor 7TH, Major 7TH, Perfect Octave.
